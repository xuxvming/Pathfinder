    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    3D:C6:52:97:E4:42:16:3B:D2:6C:5E:1A:44:BC:10:B3:84:91:F0:8A

    3D:C6:52:97:E4:42:16:3B:D2:6C:5E:1A:44:BC:10:B3:84:91:F0:8A

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
